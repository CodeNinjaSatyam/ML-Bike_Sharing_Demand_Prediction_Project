## Overview

This project aims to predict bike sharing demand based on historical data and various features. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the number of bikes that will be rented in the future.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information about bike rentals, weather conditions, date and time, temperature, humidity, and other relevant features. Key dataset statistics:

- Total records:8760
- Total columns: 14

## Data Preprocessing

- Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- Handled missing data, if any, to prevent bias in the analysis.
- Adjusted data types for consistency and accuracy.
- Normalized or scaled numeric features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we explored various aspects of the dataset, uncovering patterns and relationships between variables. The analysis involved:

- Visualizing data to identify trends and correlations.
- Understanding the distribution of key features.
- Extracting meaningful insights from the data.

## Model Selection

For the bike sharing demand prediction, we selected a regression model that is well-suited for forecasting tasks.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Trained the selected model on the training data.
- Evaluated the model's performance using regression metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Utilized cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Fine-tuned the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

## Model Deployment

Deployed the trained model to make predictions for future bike sharing demand.

### Challenges

Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges, including:

- Handling duplicate data and ensuring data consistency.
- Addressing initial data type issues to enable accurate analysis.
- Selecting appropriate visualization techniques to effectively represent the data.
- Dealing with missing values to avoid bias in the results.
